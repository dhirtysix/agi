This repository contains a simple web-based UI for controlling a Kubernetes-backed RTS game. The interface lets you create server farms, scale them, and upgrade their container images via calls to a game server API.

## UI

Open `client/index.html` in a browser. Set the game server URL, then use the form to create farms or manage existing ones.
